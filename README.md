# London Sounds

<b>Basic: Classifying an audio clip as indoor or outdoor</b>

Problem Statement: 
Given a corpus of audio files and information about their recording locations, can we build a machine learning model that predicts whether an audio clip has been recorded indoors or outdoors?

<b>Advanced: Intelligent Emergency Location Identification via Audio</b>

Problem Statement: 
Consider a scenario, a person needs urgent care and calls the emergency service. However, due to their ill state, such as feeling faint or incoherence in understanding situation, they are unable to communicate their location to the helpline operator. To track this person's location, the operator could use -
1. GPS tracking, but due to privacy concerns it is sometimes difficult to obtain this.
2. Locate the reception tower that connected the call, but calls sometimes do not connect to the nearest tower, making it difficult to rely on.

Using the MLEnd London Sounds corpus and information about their recording locations, can we build a machine learning model that predicts the location of an audio clip?
